The tools used to solve these challenges can vary depending on the type of challenge, but here are a few examples of tools that can be used in CTFs:


These are just a few examples of the tools that can be used to solve CTF challenges, there are many more tools and techniques that can be used depending on the specific challenge.

Please note that the use of these tools and techniques should only be done in a controlled and legal environment, such as a CTF competition. Attempting to use these tools or techniques without permission or on systems that you do not own or control is illegal and can result in serious consequences.

It's also important to note that CTF challenges are designed to be difficult, and solving them often requires knowledge of various security-related topics such as cryptography, network security, and web application security.

If you're interested in learning more about CTFs and participating in them, there are many online resources and communities available that can provide guidance and support.

In addition to this, you can also make use of the pre-built libraries and toolkits in Python that are available publicly and are built to solve the CTF challenges.
